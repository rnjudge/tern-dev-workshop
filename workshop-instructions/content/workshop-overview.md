Tern is a software composition analysis tool and Python library that generates a Software Bill of Materials (SBoM) for container images and Dockerfiles. The SBoM that Tern generates will give you a layer-by-layer view of what's inside your container in a variety of formats including human-readable, JSON, HTML, SPDX and more. 

In this workshop you will learn the basics of Tern and how to use it to generate an SBoM for your container images and Dockerfiles.
